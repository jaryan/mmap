Virtual R Types On Disk.
}
\description{
These functions describe the types of raw binary
data stored on disk. 
}
\usage{
char(length = 0)
int8(length = 0)
uint8(length = 0)
int16(length = 0)
uint16(length = 0)
int24(length = 0)
uint24(length = 0)
int32(length = 0)
real32(length = 0)
real64(length = 0)
cplx(length = 0)
}

\arguments{
  \item{length}{
desired length.
}
}
\details{
R has very limited storage types. There is one type
of integer and one type of float (double).  Storage
to disk often can be made more efficient by reducing
the precision of the data. These functions provide
for a sort of virtual mapping from disk to native
R type, for use with mmap-ed files.

When a memory mapping is created, a conversion method
if declared for both extracting values from disk, as well
as replacing elements on disk.  The preceeding
functions are used in the internal compiled code to
handle the conversion.

It is the user's responsibility to ensure that data
fits within the prescribed types.
}
\value{
An R typed vector of length \sQuote{length} with a
virtual type and class \sQuote{Ctype}. Additional
information related to number of bytes and whether
the vitrual type is signed is also contained.

\note{
R vectors may be used to create files on disk
matching the specified type using the functions
\code{writeBin} with the appropriate \code{size}
argument. See also.

\section{Warning }{
The is no attempt to store or read metadata with
respect to the extracted or replaced data. This
is simply a low level interface to facilitate
data reading and writing.
